# SmartPicker - picking software
A much cleaner and better verison of my quote-extractor (using quickbooks API) will add functionality soon! :)


So far I have implemented a way to retreive and display quote data. Also have the ability to upload a product database. Once a quote Id is entered and the information about the quote is displayed I can scan a barcode which checks if it exisits within the quote and a modal appears where you can input the amount of products placed. Also added features that include the following:
- Add products / set them to be picked later
- Upload excel sheet of product names and barcodes

THINGS THAT WILL BE ADDED:
- add products to the quote (DONE!)
- save products to be added later (e.g for butter as we do not add to pallet until we send the order) (DONE!)
- admin option which can turn quote into an invoice
- show the past quotes within 2 days as being always displayed as well as that option to search for specific quotes (added better system now shows active quotes for customer DONE!)
- Search by Customer not by id (DONE!)
- Convert to a real database
- Nice UI
- MORE TESTS!
