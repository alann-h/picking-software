A much cleaner and better verison of my quote-extractor (using quickbooks API) will add functionality soon! :)


So far I have implemented a way to retreive and display quote data. Also have the ability to upload a product database.

THINGS THAT WILL BE ADDED:
- proper user login as currently i only save one token on the whole backend instead of per user (save token to db)
- add products to the quote
- save products to be added later (e.g for butter as we do not add to pallet until we send the order)
- admin option which can turn quote into an invoice
- show the past quotes within 2 days as being always displayed as well as that option to search for specific quotes
- seperate /estimates into two calls one as a post and one as a get
